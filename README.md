Todo List Project
Description

This project is my first attempt at creating a dynamic web application. In this project, I have implemented a simple Todo List where users can add, search, and delete todos. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to dive deeper into DOM manipulation, handling user input, and local storage for persisting data.
Technologies Used

    HTML5: Used to structure the content of the application.

    CSS3: Used to style the application with a clean and responsive design, utilizing Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness.

    JavaScript: Used to handle the logic of the application, including adding and removing items from the Todo list, and saving the list to localStorage to persist across sessions.

    DOM Manipulation: This was my first experience working with the DOM (Document Object Model) to interact with HTML elements dynamically.

    Bootstrap: Used to quickly build a responsive layout and style the app.

Features

    Add Todo: Allows users to add new todo items by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Todo" button.

    Delete Todo: Each todo has a delete button, enabling users to remove completed tasks from the list.

    Search Todo: Users can search for specific todo items.

    Persistence: Todos are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage so that they persist even after a page reload.

Learning Experience

This project marked my first experience using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I learned how to:

    Dynamically create and manage HTML elements with JavaScript.

    Add event listeners to handle user actions (e.g., adding, deleting, searching items).

    Work with localStorage to persist data across browser sessions.

    Use Bootstrap for quick styling and responsive design, ensuring the app looks good on different screen sizes.
